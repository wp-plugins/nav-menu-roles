== Description ==

This plugin lets you hide custom menu items based on user roles.  So if you have a link in the menu that you only want to show to logged in users, certain types of users, or even only to logged out users, this plugin is for you.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `plugin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to Appearance > Menus
1. Edit the menu items accordingly.  First select whether you'd like to display the item to all logged in users, all logged out users or to customize by role.  
1. If you chose customize by role, then you you can check the boxes next to the roles you'd like to restrict visibility to.
1. If you choose 'By Role' and don't check any boxes, the item will be visible to everyone like normal. 

== Screenshots ==
1. Show the new options for the menu items in the admin menu customizer
